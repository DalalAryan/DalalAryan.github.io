About Me!
======
Hi! My name is Aryan but I like to go by Aru. I'm an applied mathematics/cse undergraduate at UCLA. I like backpacking (and all other derivatives of it: hiking, camping, mountaineering), pickleball, soccer, matcha and drawing. I also enjoy cooking but haven't tried baking yet. If you'd like to contact me, **[aryandalal at ucla dot edu](aryandalal@ucla.edu)** will be my preferred method of communication. 

Backpacking
======
I joined The UCLA Backpacking Club (TUBC) my freshman year and we backpacked *Joshua Tree National Park, CA*, *Anza Borego Desert State Park, CA* and $Big Sur, CA*. I have met some really cool people on these trips (who are not just math majors!) and taken some breathtaking photographs. Here are a few from my camera roll!

*I actually have to add photographs here, they don't just magically appear (I wish they did though)*. I will do the needful *soon*.
