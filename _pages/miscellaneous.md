About Me!
------
Hi! My name is Aryan but I like to go by Aru. I'm an applied mathematics/cse undergraduate at UCLA. I like backpacking (and all its derivatives: hiking, camping, mountaineering), pickleball, soccer, matcha and drawing. I also enjoy cooking but haven't tried baking yet. If you'd like to contact me, **[aryandalal at ucla dot edu](aryandalal@ucla.edu)** will be my preferred method of communication. 

Recently, I have been learning *Feather: Draw in 3D*. I saw a YouTube video on it and found it quite interesting that I can bring my boring 2D sketches of Formula 1 cars to life. Turns out, drawing in 3D is as hard as it sounds :/

I am an avid enjoyer of <www.sudoku.com>. I unlocked the *Extreme* level on the Sudoku app. 

Friends

**Brandon** - my good friend. I call him Brandy because it sounds cool. he carries his camera everywhere and loves everything movies. he and I share some similar music tastes in clairo, wallows and matt maltese.

Backpacking
------
I joined The UCLA Backpacking Club (TUBC) my freshman year and we backpacked *Joshua Tree National Park, CA*, *Anza Borego Desert State Park, CA* and *Big Sur, CA*. I have met some really cool people on these trips (who are not just math majors!) and taken some breathtaking photographs. Here are a few from my camera roll!

*I actually have to add photographs here, they don't just magically appear (I wish they did though)*. I will do the needful *soon*.
