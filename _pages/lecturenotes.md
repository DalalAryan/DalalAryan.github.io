**Important Note**: I am still working on updating lecture notes for several courses. So far, Math 170E, Math 136, Math 32AH and Math 31B are ready to access. Further, I will soon update this page with course notes for Fall 2025: Real Analysis, Numerical Analysis, Applied Differential Equations and Quantum Mechanics.
