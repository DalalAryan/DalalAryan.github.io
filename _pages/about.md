Hi! I am a 2nd year Applied Mathematics & Computer Science Engineering undergraduate at UCLA. I am working with [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) at the [Mathematical Machine Learning Group](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/#People). In Summer 2025, I worked on a Skin-Cander Prediction Model with 3-D Total Body Photographs. My research interests are in optimization, signal processing, computer vision, and mathematical machine learning. 

I am participating in a Directed Reading program (DRP) project with [William Chang](https://williamc.me/) in Tokenization & Reinforcement Learning. I am also committed to a year-long development of a LiDAR based autonomous vehicle as part of an IEEE @ UCLA project. 

My `Fall 2025` coursework is: Real Analysis, Machine Learning, Neural Signal Processing & Brain-Computer Interface, Numerical Analysis and R Programming. 

You can reach me by email at [aryandalal@ucla.edu](aryandalal@ucla.edu).
