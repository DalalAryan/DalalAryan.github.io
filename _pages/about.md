### About Me

Hello! My name is Aryan Dalal and I'm an undergraduate Applied Mathematics & Computer Science Engineering student at UCLA. I'm passionate about problem-solving and creating cool (often trivial yet interesting) projects. On this website, you will be able to find information about my interests, my courses, projects and hobbies. I hope you have a good read!

Currently, I am working with [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) at the [Mathematical Machine Learning Group](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/#People) on Quantification and Verification of ML/AI Systems.
