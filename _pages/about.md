Hi! I am a 2nd year Applied Mathematics & Computer Science Engineering undergraduate at UCLA. I am working with [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) at the [Mathematical Machine Learning Group](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/#People) on Quantification and Verification of AI Systems. 

## Academic Interests

I'm learning about Mathematical Machine Learning, Convex & Non-Convex Optimization Theory, Signal Processing and Mathematical Logic for Neural Network/Deep Learning Theory. I am curious about the applications of mathematical machine learning to automated reasoning, decision processes and verification of ML/AI systems. 

## Experiences
- Soundness & Completeness of Neural Network Verification Systems with [Mathematical Machine Learning Group](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/#People), advised by [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) and [Hao Duan](https://hao-duan.com).
- Directed Reading program (DRP) project with [William Chang](https://williamc.me/) in Tokenization & Reinforcement Learning.
- IEEE Autonomous Vehicle Project with Robot Operating System, Convolutional Neural Networks and Raspberry Pi.

## Seminars, Conferences, Events & Talks
- Participant, Verification, Expressivity and Parameterization of ReLU Neural Networks by Moritz Gillo, Max Plank Institute MIS\(UCLA Applied Mathematics Colloqium & UCLA Mathematical Machine Learning Seminar; November 26 2025)
- Admitted Scholar, Practicum for Undergraduate Admissions in Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation (UCLA NSF Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics; November 23-24, 2025)

Outside of mathematics and computer science, I like to play sudoku, chess, pickleball, soccer, and backpack to new national forests. I speak English, Hindi and Spanish (in limited capacity). I like coffee and taking photos of random things.
